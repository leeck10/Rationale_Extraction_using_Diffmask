# Rationale_Extraction_using_DIFFMASK

## Introduction

For the NLI and sentiment analysis tasks, the rationale for the prediction result can be extracted using the post-analysis model.
To utilize the extracted rationale, we propose a method for integrating rationale information using rationale embedding.
Rationale embedding is effective in improving the model's performance by helping the model's prediction process.
It was shown that the rationale extracted using the post-hoc analysis model has significant information.
